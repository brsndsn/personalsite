                Hi there! 
                <br>
                <br>
                I am going to be a freshman at KU starting in Fall 2023. I'm not totally sure what I want my major to be, but I am interested in attending law school in the future. 
                In my free time, I am interested in writing, reading, web development and coding, learning German, and going for long walks (when whether permits!). I've written about 20 poems thus far, and I plan on sending them for publication in the beginning of 2023. 
                I just recently graduated from <a href="https://insightks.k12.com/">Insight School of Kansas</a> as the valedictorian of my class, and am currently seeking jobs in my local area.

    <h2>Literary Work</h2>
        <p>I write poetry everyday and am often reading several hours a day. My biggest literary influences are Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, and John Steinbeck.
        My poetry is often of a confessional nature and concerns details of my life and how they seem to manifest in mundane objects of life (nature, chores, etc.)
        I'm planning on sending this batch of poems I'm writing off for publication (hopefully!) in January 2023. 

        <br>
        <br>

        My favorite novels I have read are <em>The Bell Jar</em> by Sylvia Plath, <em>Of Mice and Men</em> by John Steinbeck, <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em> 
        by Lorraine Hansberry, <em>The Great Gatsby</em> by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and <em>Red Comet</em> by Heather Clark.
